Summarise your findings here (see specification).

From my program I have deduced that "mystery1.dat" is the Sudoku file of "exteremly hard" difficulty. This was deduced from:

1. The time taken to compile, which is significantly longer than the time for the other sudoku files. The time talem was of the order of ~180,000 clock ticks, which is a system dependant variable. This is in comparison to 1063 clock ticks as the time taken to solve the "easy" board. The "mystery1" board took nearly 170 times longer to solve.
2. The number of calls to "make_move" required before completion is a huge 421,546 times! This is also in comparison to the 2172 times to solve "easy" (194 times more make_move calls). 

I have also deduced that "mystery2" is impossible to solve using the recursive method I have programmed. The solver function returns a false value every time it has been called for it. I independantly verified this on http://www.sudoku-solutions.com/ where it deemed the input unsolvable.


I have determined the "mystery3" board to be of hard difficulty. The board took ~6900 clock ticks to solve in comparison to 1063 clock ticks (or 6.5 times longer) for the board of "easy" difficulty. The board took 14,133 calls to make_move to solve (6.5 times more).
